Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw data, handles missing values, encodes categorical features.

Feature Engineering: Extracts and processes relevant features like BHK, area, and location.

Outlier Removal: Detects and removes outliers to improve model accuracy.

Modeling: Trains a Linear Regression model on historical property data.

Prediction Interface: Users can input property details and receive predicted prices.

Visualization: Includes graphs like scatter plots and histograms for better data insights.
