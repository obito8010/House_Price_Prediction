# House_Price_Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model using Linear Regression to predict house prices in Bangalore based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and location. The model processes and cleans data to provide accurate price predictions, and is deployed via a web application built with Streamlit for easy user interaction.
